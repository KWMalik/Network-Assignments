    <h3>Assignment #3 - Reliable Data Transport Protocol</h3>
    
<h3>Assignment overview:</h3>
    <p>
      In this assignment, you will be implementing the sending and receiving side of a
      reliable data transport (RDT) protocol.  Your protocol should achieve error-free,
      loss-free, and in-order data delivery on top of a link medium that can lose, 
      reorder, and corrupt packets.  Your implementation can follow any variation of 
      the sliding window protocol, e.g., Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat, or the TCP rdt 
      protocol.  Since we don't have machines with OS that we can modify, your 
      implementation will run in a simulated environment.  This simulated environment 
      is carefully constructed to follow the behavior of real systems.  This also means 
      that your program should be written in the same programming language as the 
      simulator -- <b>C/C++</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The routines you need to implement:</b> <br>
      Only unidirectional transfer data is required in this assignment.  Of course,
      the receiver may need to send back packets to acknowledge receipt of data.
      The routines you need to implement are for the RDT layer at both the sending
      and receiving side of a data transfer session.  These routines will be called
      by the simulated environment when corresponding events occur.  The overall
      structure of the environment is shown below:
    </p>

<img src="rdt.jpg" alt="RDT environment"/>

    </p>
      The unit of data passed between the upper layer and the RDT layer is the 
      <i>message</i>, which is declared as:
    <pre>
struct message {
    int size;
    char *data;
};
    </pre>
      <code>message.size</code> indicates the size of <code>message.data</code>
      measured in bytes.  The reliable data transport protocol requires the data in the 
      receiving node being delivered in order.  It does not, however, require the 
      preservation of message boundaries.
    </P>

    <p>
      The unit of data passed between the RDT layer and the lower layer is the
      <i>packet</i>, which is declared as:
    <pre>
#define RDT_PKTSIZE 128
struct packet {
    char data[RDT_PKTSIZE];
};
    </pre>
      This means that the lower layer always deliver packets in 128-byte chunks.
      Therefore, fragmentation may be necessary if the message passed from the upper
      layer is too big to fit into a packet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The routines you need to implement are detailed below.  Such routines in real-life
      would be part of the operating system.
      <ul>
      <li>
	<code>void Sender_Init();</code> - sender initialization, called once at the 
	very beginning.  This routine is here to help you.  Leave it blank if you don't
	need it.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>Sender_Final();</code> - sender finalization, called once at the very end.
	This routine is here to help you.  Leave it blank if you don't need it.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Sender_FromUpperLayer(struct message*);</code> - called when a message
	is passed from the upper layer at the sender.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Sender_FromLowerLayer(struct packet*);</code> - called when a packet 
	is passed from the lower layer at the sender.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Sender_Timeout();</code> - called when the timer expires at the
	sender.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Receiver_Init();</code> - receiver initialization, called once at the 
	very beginning.  This routine is here to help you.  Leave it blank if you don't 
	need it.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Receiver_Final();</code> - receiver finalization, called once at the 
	very end.  This routine is here to help you.  Leave it blank if you don't need it.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Receiver_FromLowerLayer(struct packet *pkt);</code> - called when a 
	packet is passed from the lower layer at the receiver.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <b>The routines you can call (implemented by the simulated environment):</b> <br>
      The routines you can call (implemented by the simulated environment) are detailed 
      below.  Such routines in real-life would also be part of the operating system.
      <ul>
      <li>
	<code>void Sender_StartTimer(double timeout);</code> - start the sender timer 
	with a specified <code>timeout</code> (in seconds).  This timer is canceled when
	<code>Sender_StopTimer()</code> is called or a new 
	<code>Sender_StartTimer()</code> is called before the current timer expires.
	<code>Sender_Timeout()</code> will be called when the timer expires.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Sender_StopTimer();</code> - stop the sender timer.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>bool Sender_isTimerSet();</code> - check whether the sender timer is being 
	set, return true if the timer is set, return false otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Sender_ToLowerLayer(struct packet*);</code> - pass a packet to the 
	lower layer at the sender for delivery.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Receiver_ToLowerLayer(struct packet*);</code> - pass a packet to
	the lower layer at the receiver for delivery.
	</code>
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>void Receiver_ToUpperLayer(struct message*);</code> - deliver a message to 
	the upper layer at the receiver.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The simulated network environment:</b> <br>
      The overall structure of the environment is shown 
      in the above figure.  There is one and only one timer 
      available at the sender.  The underlying link medium can lose,
      reorder, and corrupt packets.  The default one-way latency for this link is 100ms
      when the link does not reorder the packets.  After you compile your code and my code
      together and run the resulting program, you will be asked to specify the following 
      parameters for the simulation environment.
      <ul>
      <li>
	<code>sim_time</code> - total simulation time, the simulation will end at this 
	time (in seconds).
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>mean_msg_arrivalint</code> - average intervals between consecutive messages
	passed from the upper layer at the sender (in seconds).  The actual interval
	varies between zero and twice the average.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>mean_msg_size</code> - average size of messages (in bytes).  The actual size
	varies between one and twice the average.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>outoforder_rate</code> - the probability that a packet is not delivered 
	with the normal latency - 100ms.  A value of 0.1 means that one in ten packets 
	are not delivered with the normal latency.  When this occurs, the latency varies
	between zero and 200ms.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>loss_rate</code> - packet loss probability: a value of 0.1 means that one 
	in ten packets are lost on average.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>corrupt_rate</code> - packet corruption probability: a value of 0.1 means 
	that one in ten packets (excluding those lost) are corrupted on average.  Note 
	that any part of a packet can be corrupted.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>tracing_level</code> - levels of trace printouts (higher level always 
	prints out more information): a tracing level of 0 turns off all traces, a 
	tracing level of 1 turns on regular traces, a tracing level of 2 prints out the 
	delivered message.  Most likely you want to use level 1 for debugging and use
	level 0 for final testing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Helpful hints:</b> <br>
      <ul>
      <li>
	<i>Timer</i> -- There is only one physical timer available at the sender.  In
	some cases you might want to keep multiple timers simultaneously.  You can
	simulate multiple virtual timers using a single physical timer.  The basic idea
	is that you keep a chain of virtual timers ordered in their expiration time and
	the physical timer will go off at the first virtual timer expiration.
      </li>
      <li>
	<i>Timeout</i> -- The average oneway packet latency in the simulation is 0.1 second
	(the latency of a particular packet may be higher than the average).  For the
	round-trip timeout value for retransmission, I recommend you to set it at 0.3 
	second.  I make no guarantee that this is the best timeout value.
      </li>
      <li>
	<i>Window size</i> -- Too big a window size may affect the efficiency of Go-Back-N 
	(it needs to retransmit the entire window at a timeout).  I recommend you to use
	a window size of 10.  Again, I make no guarantee that this is the best setting.
      </li>
      <li>
	<i>Data buffer at the sender</i> -- You may need extra data buffer at the 
	sender in addition to the send window.  The reason is that the upper layer may 
	wish to send data at a faster rate than the link capacity for a sustained period 
	of time.  Without additional buffering, data may be lost when the send window is 
	full and another message is passed from the upper layer at the sender.  This
	buffer should be drained when slots in the send window become available.
	<b><font color="ff0000">Note:</font></b> An alternative here is to
	block the sending application if there is no free slot in the send window and the
	application wants to send more.  This is not an option here due to the nature of
	the simulator --- the blocking of any routine will block the whole simulator.
      </li>
      <li>
	<i>Error detection and checksumming</i> -- You will need some kind of checksumming
	to detect errors.  The Internet checksum 
	is a good candidate here.  Remember that no checksumming can detect all errors 
	but your checksum should have sufficient number of bits (e.g. 16 bit in Internet 
	checksum) to make undetected errors very rare.  We can not guarantee completely 
	error-free delivery because of checksumming's limitation.  But you should be 
	convinced that this should happen very rarely with a good checksumming technique.
      </li>
      <li>
	<i>Packet format</i> -- A key part of your design is the packet format.  The packet
	will be split into a header part and a payload part.  Some common header fields
	include payload size, sequence number, acknowledgment sequence number, and the
	checksum.
      </li>
      <li>
	<i>Random numbers</i> -- Keep in mind that many parts of the simulated 
	environments are based on random numbers, including the message arrival intervals
	and message sizes.  So two different runs with the same input parameters may not 
	generate the same results.  
      </ul>

<h3>The simulation code and your turn-in:</h3> 
    <p>
      The simulation code includes 7 files and they can be found 
      <a href="2/"><b>here</b></a>.  The simulator is in
      C++ so your code should be in C/C++ to work with the simulator.  Your will need to
      understand basic concepts about makefiles.  Come talk to me or the TA if not.
      The RDT layer is implemented in <code>rdt_sender.cc</code> and <code>rdt_receiver.cc</code>.
      The current implementation assumes there is no packet loss, corruption, or 
      reordering in the underlying link medium.  You will need to enhance them to deal 
      with all these situations.  In general, you are not supposed to change 
      <code>rdt_receiver.h</code>, <code>rdt_sender.h</code>, <code>rdt_struct.h</code>, 
      and <code>rdt_sim.cc</code>.  For debugging purpose, you may want to add more 
      printouts in <code>rdt_sim.cc</code>.  If you do so, definitely remember to test 
      your program with the original <code>rdt_sim.cc</code> before turn-in.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see, the main complexity of the simulator is enclosed in 
      <code>rdt_sim.cc</code>.  My intention is that you don't have to read and understand
      this file to complete the assignment.  You can ask for my or TA's assistance if you need
      to understand it for some reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Turn-in:</b> <br>
      You should turn in a README file, the new <code>rdt_sender.cc</code>,
      <code>rdt_receiver.cc</code>, and any new source files you added for your
      implementation.
      If the default makefile doesn't work for you, you should also turn in a new
      <code>makefile</code>.  <span class="emph">You should NOT turn in
	<code>rdt_receiver.h</code>, <code>rdt_sender.h</code>, <code>rdt_struct.h</code>,
      and <code>rdt_sim.cc</code> because we will use the original versions of those
      files in grading.</span>  Make necessary explanation in your README file for your
      turn-in.  

<pre>
	$ turnin assignment3@network rdt_sender.cc rdt_receiver.cc README ...
</pre>

    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Testing:</b> <br>
      The original versions of all files <a href="2/"><b>here</b></a> should 
      compile and run.  However, they only
      work correctly when there is no packet loss, corruption, or reordering in the 
      underlying link medium.  Run <code>rdt_sim 1000 0.1 100 0 0 0 0</code> to see what
      happens. (Ruining <code>rdt_sim</code> without parameters will tell you the usage of this program.)
      In summary, the following are a few test cases you may want to use.
      <ul>
      <li>
	<code>rdt_sim 1000 0.1 100 0 0 0 0</code> - there is no packet loss, corruption, 
	or reordering in the underlying link medium.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>rdt_sim 1000 0.1 100 0.02 0 0 0</code> - there is no packet loss or
	corruption, but there is reordering in the underlying link medium.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>rdt_sim 1000 0.1 100 0 0.02 0 0</code> - there is no packet corruption or
	reordering, but there is packet loss in the underlying link medium.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>rdt_sim 1000 0.1 100 0 0 0.02 0</code> - there is no packet loss or
	reordering, but there is packet corruption in the underlying link medium.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>rdt_sim 1000 0.1 100 0.02 0.02 0.02 0</code> - there could be packet loss, 
	corruption, or reordering in the underlying link medium.
      </li>
      </ul>
      Of course, your goal is to make the last test case work.  Keep in mind that even if
      your program works, it may still occasionally report errors due to the limitation
      of checksumming.  Your program, however, should never report errors when there is
      no packet corruption in the underlying link medium.  If your program works for some 
      cases with parameters differing from the above examples, please specify these cases
      in the README file to get partial credits.
    </p>

<h3>Grading:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>40% each for error-free, loss-free, and in-order delivery of your RDT implementation.
      </li>
      <li>60% for efficiency.  There are two aspects of efficiency.  The primary efficiency
	metric is measured by the number of packets your implementation needs to pass 
	between the sender and receiver for each particular data transfer session.  The
	secondary efficiency metric is the transmission throughput --- the maximum amount
	of data that can be successfully transmitted within a time frame.  We are mostly 
	interested in the primary efficiency metric.  We bring up the secondary metric to 
	guard against a Stop-and-Wait protocol (which does not pass too many packets to 
	complete a data transfer session, thus has very low throughput).  A reasonable 
	implementation of Go-Back-N protocol should get you full credits on the
	efficiency. 
       <!--	We will award 10% extra credit for the student with the best 
	efficiency (primary metric) and a reasonable throughput (that is, DO NOT turn in
	a Stop-and-Wait protocol).
